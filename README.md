# functionExpression
A function expression is a way to define a function as part of an expression. It's defined using the function keyword without a function name (anonymous function) or by assigning it to a variable or property.
Key characteristics of function expressions:

    Not Hoisted: Function expressions are not hoisted, so you must define them before you can call them.

    May Be Anonymous: Function expressions can be anonymous, which means they don't have to have a name, but they can if you want to reference them.

    Common Use Cases: Function expressions are often used when you want to assign a function to a variable, pass functions as arguments to other functions, or define functions inside other functions (closures).
